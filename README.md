Yet another multipurpose (but mainly focused on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh">osu!</a>) Discord bot.
</p>

## ℹ️ Information
Quna runs on Discord.js v13 and is built on TypeScript. She's owned, developed and maintained by [Tunnelblick#0001](https://discord.com/users/203932549746130944), and being designed by [Arumi#9999](https://discord.com/users/181380205670170624). Repo is named v2 as v1 repo is private and defunct. 

## 💠 Features
Quna is still waiting to receive some extra features, but this is what she has right now:
- osu!
    - Your usual osu! commands from every other bot you know (!osu, !top, !r, !c)
    - But with some neat features (Charts, Timezone Adaption, Farming Hours/Days)
    - Also combines or improves on features unique to a single bot (now defunct [Tiny Bot](https://github.com/Tienei/TinyBot)'s !card and !osu -ts)

- Other Commands
    - Apex Legends map rotation support
    - SauceNAO reverse image searching support
    - Standard Discord bot commands (8ball, choose, rate)

## 🈳 Availability
v1 Quna used to be in a single private server, but v2 is now invitable by everyone [here!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=957969843343200276&permissions=2147863616&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

Feel free to discover how to do so though! Yours truly, ∞∞(σ∀σ*)∞∞
