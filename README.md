# Quna
Yet another multipurpose (but mainly focused on osu!) Discord bot recode version 2.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information
Quna runs on Discord.js v13 and is built on Typescript. She's owned, developed and maintained by [Tunnelblick#0001](https://discord.com/users/203932549746130944) and [Arumi#5555](https://discord.com/users/181380205670170624), and lives in Caf√© Arumina. 

## üí† Features
As Quna is still literally a work in progress, this list should be updated somewhat regularly.
- osu!
    - Your usual osu! commands from every other bot you know...
    - With some extras tacked on with it!

- APIs
    - Apex Legends map rotation display!
    - Danbooru tag support! (no r18 flag though, be warned)
    - KSFClan servers map display! 
    - SauceNAO reverse image searching support!

- Miscellaneous
    You know what, just find out for yourself.

## üà≥ Availability
Currently, Quna only exists in Caf√© Arumina, a private server owned by Arumi. No, you can't invite her to other servers, and no, Arumi is not inviting anyone that stumbles upon this repo to Caf√© Arumina. She'll be public sometime soon though, so don't you worry!

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è [Bug Reports](https://github.com/AppelsPen/Quna/issues)
Yes, Quna is filled with bugs. If you're a member of Caf√© Arumina and have arrived here, open a new issue [over here](https://github.com/Tunnelbliick/qunav2/issues), or just click that big ass blue bug report. Drop a screenshot of what seems wrong and title it appropriately, and (hopefully) someone will get to it!
