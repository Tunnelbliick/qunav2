# Quna
Yet another multipurpose (but mainly focused on osu!) Discord bot. Aptly named v2 due to a recode, and as v1 is a defunct private repo.

## ℹ️ Information
Quna runs on Discord.js v13 and is built on TypeScript. She's owned, developed and maintained by [Tunnelblick#0001](https://discord.com/users/203932549746130944) and [Arumi#5555](https://discord.com/users/181380205670170624).

## 💠 Features
As Quna is still literally a work in progress, this list should be updated somewhat regularly.
- osu!
    - Your usual osu! commands from every other bot you know
    - But with some neat features (Charts, Timezone Adaption, Farming Hours/Days)
    - Also combines or improves on features unique to a single bot ([Tiny Bot's](https://github.com/Tienei/TinyBot) (defunct) !card)

- Other Games
    - Apex Legends (Map rotation display)

- Art
    - Danbooru tag support (may be removed in v2 deploy)
    - SauceNAO reverse image searching support

- Miscellaneous
    - Standard Discord bot commands (8ball, choose, rate)
