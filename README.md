# Quna
Yet another multipurpose (but mainly focused on osu!) Discord bot. Repo is named v2 as v1 repo is private and defunct.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information
Quna runs on Discord.js v13 and is built on TypeScript. She's owned, developed and maintained by [Tunnelblick#0001](https://discord.com/users/203932549746130944), and being designed by [Arumi#5555](https://discord.com/users/181380205670170624).

## üí† Features
As Quna is still literally a work in progress, this list should be updated somewhat regularly.
- osu!
    - Your usual osu! commands from every other bot you know (!osu, !top, !r, !c)
    - But with some neat features (Charts, Timezone Adaption, Farming Hours/Days)
    - Also combines or improves on features unique to a single bot (now defunct [Tiny Bot](https://github.com/Tienei/TinyBot)'s !card and !osu -ts)

- Other Commands
    - Apex Legends map rotation support
    - SauceNAO reverse image searching support
    - Standard Discord bot commands (8ball, choose, rate)

## üà≥ Availability
v1 Quna used to be in a single private server, but v2 is now invitable by everyone [here!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=957969843343200276&permissions=2147863616&scope=applications.commands%20bot)
